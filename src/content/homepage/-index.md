### Summary
The increasing availability of multimodal data, including images and videos, has led to a surge of interest in multimodal models that combine visual and textual information. This tutorial will provide an in-depth introduction to the latest advances in multimodal models, with a focus on large vision-language models. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, code demonstrations, and hands-on exercises, participants will learn how to apply these models to a range of image and video analysis tasks, including image captioning, visual concept detection, and image retrieval. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will have a solid understanding of the strengths and limitations of these models, enabling them to implement their own multimodal applications.

### **Presenters**

#### **Eric Müller-Budack**

Eric Müller-Budack is leading the Visual Analytics Research Group at TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology. He received his PhD from the Leibniz University Hannover in 2021. His main research interests include automatic multimedia indexing, multimedia and multimodal information retrieval, and deep learning for multimedia analysis and retrieval.

#### **Sushil Awale** 

Sushil Awale is a research associate in the Visual Analytics research group at TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology and a third-year PhD student at Leibniz Universität Hannover. His research interests center on multimodal modeling and information retrieval.
